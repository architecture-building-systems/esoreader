esoreader
=========

A python module for reading \*.eso files generated by EnergyPlus

The eso files generated by EnergyPlus contains a data dictionary, which
describes the values reported by EnergyPlus. The list of values reported
depends on the simulation input file, specifically the Output:Variable
objects. EnergyPlus can output the same variable at different
frequencies and for different "keys", which are for instance surfaces or
equipment names.

Following the data dictionary is a list of output variable values for
each of the configured variable coordinates.

The output of the esoreader module is therefore a data dictionary object
that contains a mapping of variable "coordinates" (grouping of reporting
frequency, key and variable name) to the index used by EnergyPlus and a
data object, which essentially just maps that index to the timeseries
data.

Example
=======

.. code:: python

    import esoreader

    PATH_TO_ESO = r'/Path/To/EnergyPlus/Output/eplusout.eso'
    dd, data = esoreader.read(PATH_TO_ESO)
    frequency, key, variable = dd.find_variable('Zone Ventilation Total Heat Loss Energy')[0]
    idx = dd.index[frequency, key, variable]
    time_series = data[idx]
